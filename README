NAME
        edit - line-by-line text editor

SYNOPSIS
        edit [file]

DESCRIPTION
        This program can be used for editing plain text files.

        To start editing a file, use the command
            
            edit file
        
        There are no options.

        These are the commands used while the editor is running:

            p       print out all lines in the file

            n       print out all lines in the file with line numbers

            q       quit the program

            d       delete the current line

            m[n]    move the current line to be the line before line n
                    if n is '$', move the current line to be the last line in the file

            i       begin inserting text before the current line

            a       begin inserting text after the current line

            w       write the current buffer to the file

        If an entered command is invalid, the editor will show '!>' on the next line instead of the default '->'
